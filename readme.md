This is a tiles retro game in **JavaScript** for the **"Le coin des dev's"** Discord server **DevJam** who can become easily infuriating.

## Notes
---
The game work only on desktop. I enjoy work on this project, the next time I would like to be in a team.

During the DevJam, I used an old project (that was allowed) and I added :
* Timer
* Music
* Present recovery & counter
* Presents high score
* Tiles textures
* Zones
* Door between zones
* Grass animation
* Player animation
* Presentation screen
* Comments
* This readme

And I changed :

* Player gravity & collisions
* Controls: ZQSD to arrows keys (to make it universal)
* HTML & CSS (more responsive & font)
* Canvas display (more responsive)
